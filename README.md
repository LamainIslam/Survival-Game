## Introduction
Welcome to our survival game prototype. This project demonstrates the core mechanics of player movement, resource collection, crafting, combat, and interaction with the environment.

## How to Play

### Player Movement
- **Camera Control**: The cursor is locked to the camera. Move the camera by moving the mouse.
- **Walking**: Use the `WASD` keys to move.
- **Jumping**: Press `Space` to jump.
- **Sprinting**: Hold `Shift` while walking to sprint.
- **Crouching**: Press `Control` to crouch.
- **Sliding**: After running, press crouch to slide. Alternatively, hold `Alt` to slide more easily.

### Picking Up Items
- **Pick up Items**: When in range and looking at an item, press `F` to pick it up.
  - Items include wood, stone, torches, tools and armor.

### Inventory Management
- **Toolbar**: Use the scroll wheel to switch between items in your toolbar.
- **Open Inventory**: Press `E` to open the inventory.
- **Item Movement**: Drag and drop items into different slots using the left mouse button.
  - To split a stack of items, use the right mouse button while dragging.
- **Equipment**: Certain slots are reserved for specific items (e.g., offhand for torches).
- **Close Inventory**: Press `E` again to close the inventory.

### Crafting
- **Crafting Items**: Add items to the crafting area in the inventory. If you meet the requirements, craft the item.
- **Changing Recipes**: Use arrows in the crafting menu to switch between crafting recipes.
- **Move to Toolbar**: After crafting, drag and drop the item into the toolbar for easy access.

### Using Items
- **Equipping Items**: Drag armor into the correct slot or hold it to increase defense (shown on the top left of the screen).
- **Tool Usage**: Axes and pickaxes can break trees and rocks, respectively. These actions drop resources like wood and stone.

### Enemies
- **Green Capsules**: Passive enemies that flee when they see you. Can be killed to drop resources.
- **Yellow Capsules**: Neutral enemies that won't attack unless provoked. Once attacked, they become aggressive and chase you.
- **Red Capsules**: Hostile enemies that will attack on sight. Their attacks decrease your health.

### Health and Hunger
- **Health**: Your health is displayed in the top left. It regenerates over time unless youâ€™re attacked.
- **Hunger**: Eat steak to increase your hunger, displayed in the yellow bar on the top left.

### Death
- **Player Death**: Your character dies when health reaches zero or less, or falls off the map

### Biomes and Environment
- **Plains Biome**: Green surface with many trees and few rocks. Passive, neutral and hostile enemies spawn here.
- **Snow Biome**: White surface with mostly rocks and dead trees. Located farther from spawn, this area has more neutral and hostile enemies.

### Day/Night Cycle
The game features a dynamic day and night cycle, where the light rotates to simulate time progression.
